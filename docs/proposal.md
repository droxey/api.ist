# Proposal


## Make APIs With Us
Make APIs With Us is your go to web resource when looking for APIs to implement with your projects. It will contain a gallery of many useful User submitted APIs. Each API displays an overview of the API and a description of how to use it. (<-- pull info from README).

Users will also be able to showcase APIs they have made by displaying them in their (portfolio/profile). This will allow them to gain exposure for their APIs and get users. It will also allow them to get feedback as other users can comment.


###Make APIs accommodates 2 main user types:
1. Developers looking for APIs they can integrate into their projects
    - this will include Front End and Mobile students who cannot create their own backends/apis yet.
2. Developer (Make School Students) trying to gain exposure for APIs they have made

## How will it work?
- By allowing users to login with Github they will easily be able to upload repos. It will also be easier for us to display correct information by using the users API README. (adds ease of use for "User Type 2" to upload APIs to their portfolio and get started contributing to our app)

- By implementing a tag system we can easily separate APIs into different categories, making it easier for "User Type 1" to easily look find relevant APIs for their project.


- APIs will be the main resource and will be displayed in 3 different places:
1. Global Feed: global feed is where popular apis will be shown on a instagram/twitter style feed.
2. Explore: This is where users can search for APIs by user, api name, or tags.
3. User Portfolios: This is where a gallery of a specific users api will be displayed
4. Show Single API: Displays single API with info:
    - Overview of API
    - README info (how to use)

## Other Resources/Functionality:
- Comments on APIs
- Users will be able to like/favorite apis
